# Bio-server-implementation
This is a simple example on how a server implemented by UsbWebServer and php back-end is implemented with a database created and saved in phpMyAdmin, included languages are HTML CSS Javascript and PHP.
it is expected of course that this server will be modified by time to improve its quality, it is a good way to revise how php backend works.

In this comprised file you will find built-in files related to the .exe program called usbwebserver.exe(where you can check the server page and its database in phpmyadmin).
the root file is where the code scripts are written(one php file contain the whole project and its css and image), apply the exe program and click on local host to view the output, and phpMyAdmin to view the database.
